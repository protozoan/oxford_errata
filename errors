Nelson claims Oxford's servant and friend at Brincknell coroner's inquest
William Walter was about the same age as Oxford - too young to have 
served on a jury. Name confirmed by NG as William Waters, anyway. The 
original says Randophi Holinshed, per NG, which cannot be translated to Ralph 
Holinshed as Nelson would have it.

Nelson claims Oxford property dealing a legal fiction
Nelson: The fact that Oxford and Elizabeth were complaining [in 1595] over property they had alienated on 2 March 1592 to her brother and uncle shows that the alienation was a legal fiction. NG points out that the Belchamp parsonage is distinct from the Belchamp rectory. The Queen gave permission on 2 March 1592 to sell and sale date was 12 March 1592, not 2 March 1592 as Nelson states.

Wrong page for CPR citation
Nelson cites CPR, 1569-72, p. 159 for a licence for de Vere to enter on his lands at age 21.
The correct location is CPR, 1569-1572, p. 450. Notably, the record was number 3159, which may partially explain the error.

Bond as an instrument versus bond as a pledge
NG objects to Nelson's: Unable to raise cash, 
Oxford raised credit in the form of a bond.   
(Sentence from book corrected by bkm). NG writes: 
He is putting up a bond as a guarantee that he will 
pay the amount pledged in the bond on September 29th 
of that year (Michaelmas). bkm supposes that NG's 
argument is that Oxford did raise cash, and promised 
via bond to pay it back.

Serjeant versus servant
Quoting NG: Alan writes that Robert Cecil and Hugh Beeston the 
younger are 'serjeants of Edward, earl of Oxford'. Compounding 
his transcription error, Alan comments: On 1 July Oxford finally 
received the grant of the attainted lands. His two 'serjeants', or 
agents, were Cecil and Hugh Beeston. The document actually reads 
'Hugh Beeston, servant of Edward, Earl of Oxford', not 'serjeant'.

Claim that Oxford had already sold Colne Priory to Roger Harlakenden by May 1588
AHN:
In May [1588], as Burghley noted in his retrospective Diary (ii, p. 788), Elizabeth re-granted to Oxford two ancient properties:
A Graunt of the Priory of Earles Colne, and the Mannor of Colne in Essex, to the Earl of Oxford, and the Heyres of his Body, yelding the Rent of 66l.
Oxford had of course already sold these lands to Roger Harlackenden.
NG states that it is well known that the sale was in 1592.

Index refers to wrong Earl of Southampton
Presumably the chapter index refers to the wardship of the third Earl in 1566, but the third Earl was not born until 1573. The second Earl was also a ward.

No 1570 proclamation on leniency toward law-abiding Catholics
Lindquist writes: This seems to be based on a misunderstanding of Elizabeth's 
famous aversion to making windows into men's souls, but there was certainly no 
such proclamation in 1570, nor in any other year.
