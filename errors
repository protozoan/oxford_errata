Nelson claims Oxford's servant and friend at Brincknell coroner's inquest
William Walter was about the same age as Oxford - too young to have 
served on a jury. Name confirmed by NG as William Waters, anyway. The 
original says Randophi Holinshed, per NG, which cannot be translated to Ralph 
Holinshed as Nelson would have it.

Nelson: The fact that Oxford and Elizabeth were complaining [in 1595] over property they had alienated on 2 March 1592 to her brother and uncle shows that the alienation was a legal fiction. NG points out that the Belchamp parsonage is distinct from the Belchamp rectory. The Queen gave permission on 2 March 1592 to sell and sale date was 12 March 1592, not 2 March 1592 as Nelson states.
