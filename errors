Nelson claims Oxford's servant and friend at Brincknell coroner's inquest
William Walter was about the same age as Oxford - too young to have 
served on a jury. Name confirmed by NG as William Waters, anyway. The 
original says Randophi Holinshed, per NG, which cannot be translated to Ralph 
Holinshed as Nelson would have it.

Nelson claims Oxford property dealing a legal fiction
Nelson: The fact that Oxford and Elizabeth were complaining [in 1595] over property they had alienated on 2 March 1592 to her brother and uncle shows that the alienation was a legal fiction. NG points out that the Belchamp parsonage is distinct from the Belchamp rectory. The Queen gave permission on 2 March 1592 to sell and sale date was 12 March 1592, not 2 March 1592 as Nelson states.

Wrong page for CPR citation
Nelson cites CPR, 1569-72, p. 159 for a licence for de Vere to enter on his lands at age 21.
The correct location is CPR, 1569-1572, p. 450. Notably, the record was number 3159, which may partially explain the error.
